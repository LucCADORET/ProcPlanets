# webgpu-rtr
A webgpu real time renderer

## Build

- clone the `glfw`, `glfw3webgpu`, `glm` git submodules to the `external` folder
- clone the `imgui` repo and add to it a `CMakeLists.txt` to it found here: https://eliemichel.github.io/LearnWebGPU/basic-3d-rendering/some-interaction/simple-gui.html#setting-up-imgui

## Content

There are various scenes in the `src/scenes` folder that showcase different stuff, just adapt the `Engine.cpp` code to load the stuff you want to see (TODO: be more specific and user friendly)

## TODOs

- Make the same architecture as https://github.com/google/filament ???
